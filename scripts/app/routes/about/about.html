    <h1>How to use the Iceberg Movies app</h1>
    <p>When first loaded, the Movies Search app reads in all the movies from the data.json file, and displays the first
        20 results.
        Once loaded, you can filter the set of
        movies you see according to movie title by typing in the name of the movie you're interested in. The list of
        movies will change as you start typing in the search box.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you type in a search term that does not match any movie title, an error message appears.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can page through the list of movies at any point, moving forwards or backwards 20 movies at a time,
        or jumping to a particular page. This works with both filtered and unfiltered movies.
    </p>
    <p>If you get too few results, just clear the text and type something else.</p>
