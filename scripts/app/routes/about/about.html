    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        This app has been designed to provide the barebones skeleton you need to start writing a scalable,
        well-architected AngularJS 1.x app with the minimum of configuration hassle, and the minimum of
        boilerplate code getting in your way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">boilerplate templates</a> include a tonne of other stuff, such
        as old browser upgrade notices, viewport definitions, favicons, Google Analytics,
        etc., etc. All of this is needed for production code, but it gets in your way if all you want is a clean
        template to begin a new project with, to create a prototype, or just to experiment with AngularJS without
        irrelevant HTML5 cruft getting in your way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Equally, other <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-seed">Angular Seed apps</a> may provide an appropriate
        place for you to start, but provide you with limited build tools. There's no minification or concatenation,
        and so you have to add manually all the files you create both to your index.html file, and your <code>karma.conf</code>
        file.
    </p>
    <p>
        To this end, this seed app is designed to get you up and running fast to explore AngularJS with the
        minimum of boilerplate so you can really see the wood from the trees. You can prototype code quickly and easily,
        with minifying, concatenating, source maps, and testing configuration all taken care of for you.
    </p>
    <h3>Main Features</h3>
    <h4>Scaffolding HTML page (i.e index.html)</h4>
    <p>
        Index.html is the main HTML scaffolding page. It contains only a custom header directive to get you started
        with directives, an <code>ng-view</code> directive in which your main content will be rendered via your
        Angular Router, and a static footer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Styling is minimal, and is provided by Bootstrap.css, and a small bit of custom CSS declared in
        <code>main.css</code>, which keeps the footer sticking to the bottom of the page (see
        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/sticky-footer/">CSS-Tricks</a> for more details).
    </p>
    <h4>App structure</h4>
    <p>
        The structure of the app has been written according to the inestimable John Papa's
        <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide">style guide</a>, with the main app folder comprising
        the following components:
        <ul>
            <li>the main appModule (config, run, constants, routes, etc,)</li>
            <li>layout components (header, footer and sidebar directives)</li>
            <li>routes (HTML templates and controllers needed for specific routes)</li>
        </ul>

        Each folder contains all files necessary for the component to render, run and be tested.
    </p>
    <h4>Code Structure</h4>
    <p>
        The AngularJS code also complies with John's style recommendations, with <code>controllerAs</code> used
        throughout, IIFE's enclosing component declarations to avoid globals, and the ViewModel represented as a
        capture variable called <code>vm</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>Building the app</h3>
    <p>
        <code>gulp build</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Before running the app, you <b>MUST</b> call the build task from the command line (note: I'm assuming you're
        not using Windows with these instructions).
    </p>
    <p>
        Once built, you shouldn't need to rebuild unless you add a new file. Editing existing files will cause the app
        to be rebuilt automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        The build task concatenates the files and minifies them, with the third party libraries built to
        <code>dist/lib.min.js</code>, and your app's code built to <code>dist/app.min.js</code>. The build task also creates
        sourcemaps, ensuring you can still debug the actual code, rather than an horrendous minified concatenated soup!
    </p>
    <p>
        The build task also looks for any AngularJS directive templates that have been defined using
        <code>templateUrl</code>. These are concatenated and written to a module, the contents of which are injected into
        <code>$templateCache</code> for you. The benefits of this are that a single HTTP request need only be made
        regardless of how many directives you create, and, more importantly, your directive tests can use the actual
        partial HTML you use in your production code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just include the <code>partials</code> module in your tests, like so:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>beforeEach(module('partials'));</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        and your directives will be magically populated with their proper partials' HTML (see Untangled.io's
        'How to Unit Test a directive with templateURL' for more details). You can see an example of this in action in
        <code>scripts/app/layout/header/header.directive.spec.js</code>
    </p>

    <h3>Running the app</h3>
    <p>
        <code>gulp serve</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once run, browse to <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code>. To change the port, just type
        <code>gulp serve --port=< your_port_number ></code>. For example, to serve the app on port 8000,
        use <code>gulp serve --port=8000</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Running <code>gulp serve</code> causes a live reload, so all your app's files are automatically rebuilt (the
        library files aren't - if you want those rebuilt, you'll need to call<code>gulp build</code> again).
    </p>
    <h3>Testing the app</h3>
    <p>
        <code>karma start</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        This runs the tests in Chrome. To see the output of the tests, click the 'debug' button in the page that's
        opened, and then open Chrome dev tools. You'll see the output of your tests in the console, and can also step
        through them using the standard dev tools debugging commands.
    </p>
